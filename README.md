## History

<div align="justify">
  Tetris is a surprising game. On paper, at least, it seems unlikely that   something so basic should have done so well beyond the year 1975.     Nevertheless, it’s been a consistently popular video game for decades.  It was invented in Russia, and it was never expected to be as popular    as it became.

## Goals

<div align="justify">
The aim in Tetris is simple; you bring down blocks from the top of the screen. You can move the blocks around, either left to right and/or you can rotate them. The blocks fall at a certain rate, but you can make them fall faster if you’re sure of your positioning. Your objective is to get all the blocks to fill all the empty space in a line at the bottom of the screen; whenever you do this, you’ll find that the blocks vanish and you get awarded some points.

<br>
A goal gives us a reason to play the game. Tetris offers an incredibly simple reason to play—pitting your wits against the computerized block dropper in order to last as long as you can.

## Rules

<div align="justify">
  Tetris has very simple rules: you can only move the pieces in specific ways; your game is over if your pieces reach the top of the screen; and you can only remove pieces from the screen by filling all the blank space in a line.
