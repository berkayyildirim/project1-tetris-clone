# Milestone 1:

## display obstacle + obstacle can move left/righ

    [x] Create project structure (html, css, js)
    [x] Create repo + upload to GitHub

    [x] Class Game
        [x] start()
            x create an instance of the class Obstacles
            x draw it

    [x] Class Obstacle
        x position
        x size (w, h)
        - moveLeft()
        - moveRight()

        [x] Set Interval obstacle
            x add interval to obstacle that move downward every second

            - event listener (key) + when obstacle presses, call move left/right

# Milestone 2:

    - stop first obstacle when reach to the bottom
    - add obstacles appearing in the UI
    - add a new obstacle when there is a collision
    - stop following obstacle when there is a collision
    - we detect if there's a collision in the starting line (Game Over)

    - note: for this milestone, it's ok if obstacles appear always at the same position
